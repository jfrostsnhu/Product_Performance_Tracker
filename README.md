This project parses a text file of purchases in chronological order and creates a new file with each item and the frequency of purchases. Additionally, the user can display a specific item and the quantity of purchases to the console via text or display the list as a histogram. 
This project was designed for a hypothetical grocery store to rearrange their produce section based on the frequency of purchases. From my perspective, I did particularly well in design of the console prompts and input validation, however there could be improvements made to improve the functionality of the program and modernize it. This project could 
include functionality to pull the purchases from a database rather than a text file and can be integrated even into the grocery store's POS or ecommerce system for efficiency. I found it most challenging to use Maps in C++ as I was not familiar with them but the documentation was very extensive and I found several helpful threads online to assist in using the class.
Use of input and output streams, text file parse/generation, input validation, and Maps will all be transferrable skills used in other projects/coursework. The program is maintainable, readable, and adaptable by the comments throughout the code which explain functionality. Additionally, there is a provided flowchart that describes the high level functionality of
the program. The project is modular as well making it adaptable and maintainable beyond that of a project using a single class.
